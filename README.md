## About This Project

This project is inspired by [`ChristianAlexander - tutorial-budget-app`](https://github.com/ChristianAlexander/tutorial-budget-app/tree/main) and serves as a practice for learning Phoenix and Elixir.
The goal is to gain hands-on experience with Phoenix while building a functional application.

## How to start

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
